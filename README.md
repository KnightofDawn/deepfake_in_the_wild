Deepfakes technology is a deep learning-based face forgery technique that can replace one's face with another's face, which we usually call "AI face swap."
As deepfakes technology is popular on the Internet, more and more people are using this technology to make their own videos.
Although some deepfake videos are only used for funny, when making malicious videos, it may have a negative impact on an individual's reputation or spread information that is unfavorable to the election and financial system. So detecting deepfakes becomes very important.

Deepfake in the wild is a dataset collected on the web.

Our dataset contains 1005 videos.
